  "content": "<p>\n            I have been developing websites professionally for over 5 years. I've built products for companies and businesses around the globe ranging from basic  websites to complex solution apps with focus on fast, elegant and accessible user experiences.\n            Most recently, I was a front end developer at <a href=\"http://netsells.co.uk/\" rel=\"external nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Netsells Ltd</a>, where I built multiple Vue.js based applications for the organisation and individuals. Before that, I was a Web developer at <a href=\"http://www.clovermark.in/\" rel=\"external nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Four Clover Realty Private Ltd</a>, where I built microsites, landing pages and internal CRM.\n       </p>\n\n<p>\n           I enjoy pushing the limits of the browser, solving difficult problems, and making usable applications. Highly self-motivated, goal-oriented with a quest and zeal to learn new technologies. I believe in innovation, passion and success.\n        </p>"
