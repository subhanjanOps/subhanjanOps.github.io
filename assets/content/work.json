It uses Nuxt.js (Vue Framework), Bootstrap4 (Scss), Netlify CMS and is hosted on Netlify. The codebase is on my GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/neveena/portfolio-site-nuxt-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">neveenaferrao/portfolio-site-nuxt-app</a>.\n\nYou can also <a href=\"/Neveena-Frontend_Developer.pdf\" download>download</a> a copy of my resume and check my  <a href=\"https://github.com/neveena\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noreferrer\">GitHub</a> for other projects.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIf you're not convinced or just curious about some of my other work, feel free to send me a mail at <a href=\"mailto:neveena.praveen@gmail.com\">neveena.praveen@gmail.com</a>.\n\n</p>"
